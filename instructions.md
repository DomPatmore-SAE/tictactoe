Open this page to find a simple tic-tac-toe grid made of inputs

1. Write code so you can grab the center square (you may need to wait for the whole page to appear)

2. Once you have the square, wait for the text to change-if the user enters X, change the background colour to blue. If the user types O, change the colour to green.

3. If a valid value (either X or O) has been entered into a box, prevent the box from being changed (what are some of the ways you can disable input for an element?). See if you can use animation to make the colour appear in interesting ways.
